# The Pandemic Made Me Fall In Love with Coding Again

Some of us have been making cake, or sourdough bread. Some have been dealing with loss of a job, or unfortunately, personal loss. Most have been trying to cope with some levels of anxiety and fear of where we are going. In the midst of it all, I (re)-discovered programming.

## The Beginning

The first computer program I saw was in a book. It was a BASIC program that calculated the next new and full moon. Windows 95 had just come out and I had just gotten hold of my first PC --after years of begging my parents and saving money-- and I was finally, _finally_ writing down this code line by line. The book was full of programs that, given your geographical coordinates and day and time, would calculate various astronomical phenomena. At that point, I had been fascinated by astronomy for a while, and I'd had the book for a couple of years at least, meticulously studying its programs line by line. But I had never gotten to run any of them. Until now! I typed it all in, prepared to execute it, and then _BAM!_ ...Error code 2, which eventually I found out meant "syntax error". Turns out there was a typo in my code. _Welcome to Programming!_ üòÅ

Once I finally got connected to the internet (thank you U.S Robotic 28800 kbps modem), I quickly discovered _sourceforge_ and _slashdot_ which inevitably introduced me to Linux. My Dad was always into formal education and he didn't see the point of me _"learning"_ by browsing these forums and newsgroups so he enrolled me in a couple of CompTIA certification courses. I remember our Network+ instructor talking about IPv4 addresses running out soon, but not to worry, IPv6 is right around the corner and is coming out any day now! If only he knew.

I found out a local LUG (Linux User Group), started contributing to KDE (doing little bug fixes) and was involved in a team that extended Qt3's i18n to better support RTL languages (I mostly ran some tests, our work eventually was upstreamed in Qt4). I made my own Linux distro (Shabdix, a remastered Knoppix) and gave a talk on Linux as a guest at a local university at the age of 17. I was very clear what I wanted to study at university: CS.

## My University Years, or How I Lost my Passion for Programming

I moved overseas, all by myself and not even 18, to attend a university that I thought would offer me a decent education. The Introduction to CS and Algorithms course was taught in _C_; there was a camp that was advocating moving to Java to teach the course, but no one had heard of Python there even though I had a Python book myself (Python 2.0 was new back then).

For my final graduation project, I teamed up with a friend and we made a "House Finder" website for the university's students, where landlords could upload pictures and details of their properties and students could search and filter them, find suitable ones and book to inspect them. IE6 was the most common browser at that point but IE5 was still around and we were told that we also needed to support Netscape 4. Needless to say, CSS was out of the question and the layout was done with `<table>` tags. On the backend, our languages of choice was PHP but the University's web servers (where the site was going to be hosted) ran Windows Server and IIS, and we were told we had to make our code run there (no such thing as Containers back then outside Solaris). Mambo was _the_ PHP CMS at that point but for various reasons, we ended up using plain PHP4, managing cookies and sessions all by hand. It was crude, it was buggy, it was insecure, but it worked. The website went live as I graduated in early 2006, and Wayback Machine tells me that the University ran it pretty much unchanged for a decade until it was redeveloped in 2016.

It is unfair to say that all of the education I received was bad, there certainly were a couple of good lecturers and I remember really enjoying my introduction to RDBMS courses and having fun normalising databases and writing performance SELECT queries. But most of it _was_ bad. I never got the impression from that any of people who taught me enjoyed coding. And I certainly lost my enthusiasm for this amazing, blossoming medium that was the Web, as every single calcified lecturer talked derisively about JavaScript and how it's not a _real_ programming language. It was drilled into me that I didn't want to just be a _code monkey_; if I wanted to be successful, I needed to climb up the management ladder as soon as possible.
